  <p>We're so hip, and we're so good that our customers always leave a 5-star review. We don't do 4-star reviews, hell, if you leave us with a 4 star review, we will point you to the small print in the contract, which explicitly states you must leave a 5-star review and then we will threaten you with our not-so-friendly lawyer. But we know we won't need to do that, because we are the best, not just in the Bay Area, but worldwide - trust us bro!</p>

        <p>Brad and Chad are amazing, they built me the best website ever and I've only had 4 legal challenges, regarding accessibility stuff, in the first month and Brad and Chad have reassured me that it's just people using my site wrong, just like people used to hold the iPhone 4 wrong, I feel so reassured. 10/10, I would highly recommend going with Brad and Chad for your next project.</p>

        <p>What can I say? Brad and Chad are the real deal, they guided me through the whole process of of building an online presence, for my new business. Nothing was ever too much trouble, they had the whole site designed, built and on the web in less than 3 hours. Totally amazing.</p>

        <p>I've been developing websites for 15 years and thought I knew everything. I didn't have time to build a personal site so I got in touch with Brad and Chad and it turns out that everything I thought I knew was just wrong. These guys had me questioning everything I thought I knew and built me a great portfolio site, that just works (92% of the time). I will definitely be sending more business their way, thanks guys.</p>

        <p>Exactly what my business needed, a pair of brothers that know more about tech than anybody else, I simply stunned at their knowledge. They rebranded my business colours as in their expert opinions, my brand colors were "Meh" and "A bit rubbish", I didn't know that and wish I had found Brad and Chad sooner. We also enabled customers to buy products directly from my page, which so far has saved me $0.87 on eBay fees, once I get the traffic Brad and Chad promise will happen, my revenue will be 7 figures, I cannot wait.</p>

      <button class="accordion__btn" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accP1">Can you make accessible websites?<span class="accordion__icon"></span></button>
    </h2>
    <div class="accordion__panel" id="accP2"><p>Yes. In fact we have been building websites that comply with WCAG 1.0 since way back in 1998. We get it, you likely have disabled users 
      that have issues with your current site and are worried about legal issues. Don't worry, we have your back, we provide solutions that will
      keep those pesky lawyers at bay, check out our <a href="/services/">Services page</a> for the choice of package</p>

      <button class="accordion__btn" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accP2">Will my website be secure?<span class="accordion__icon"></span></button>
    </h2>
    <div class="accordion__panel" id="accP3"><p>Yup. We only use the safest web protocols and encryption methods to keep your site and data safe. All our sites use the HTTP protocol 
      and the MD5 hashing algorithm.
    </p></div>
    <h2 class="accordion__heading" id="accH3" data-expanded="false">
      <button class="accordion__btn" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accP3">Can I use my own designer?<span class="accordion__icon"></span></button>
    </h2>
    <div class="accordion__panel" id="accP4">
      <p>No. Simply put, we are better and you would be making a huge mistake. We are better than the rest 
        and we know our business better than you. As an example, if your business sells luxury handmade chocolates, we consider you the 
        expert, so we would not tell you to change the recipe. Using that same logic we don't want some hipster designer telling us 
        stuff that doesn't make sense. You trust our systems and judgements and we won't tell you how to improve your chocolate (unless we don't like it).</p>

      <button class="accordion__btn" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accP4">Are your systems good value for money?<span class="accordion__icon"></span></button>
    </h2>
    <div class="accordion__panel" id="accP5">
      <p>Hell yeah. We don't feel the need to compete with regular developers, as our stuff is better. You pay a premium price 
      and get a premium product. Don't settle for less.
      </p>

    <h2 class="accordion__heading" id="accH5" data-expanded="false">
      <button class="accordion__btn" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accP5">Will my users find the sites to be intuitive?<span class="accordion__icon"></span></button>
    </h2>
    <div class="accordion__panel" id="accP5">
      <p>Most of them will. Some folks just use stuff wrong, you don't need to worry about those people, 
        because if they can't figure out how to use our sites, that's usually a good sign they will cause you problems later down the line, y'know
        "I need to return these shoes as I actually meant to order a microwave". That's far too much hassle, your genuine customers will be fine

      we can of course fix it for a fee, just send us an email to <a href="mailto:thisIsNotAValidEmailaddress@bradAndChad.com">Support @ Brad and Chad</a></p>
