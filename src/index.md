We're based in Silicon Valley but our reach is global, there is not a corner of the planet that our stunning websites have not reached. In fact, we are currently working with a client based in North Sentinel Island, that's how big our brand is.</p>
    <p class="intro__text">We take you from idea to product, guiding you through each step of the process, using our innovative skillset and complete understanding of digital technologies. We started out building websites from a garage, back in 1990, we have always been ahead of the game and continue to to challenge the boundaries in the tech space.</p>
    <p class="intro__text">We're Brad and Chad, two highschool friends, that became brothers in Brad's mom's Bay Area garage, just us, Brad's trusty Dell desktop and a drive to be thought-leaders, innovators and trend-setters in the digital space.

  <h2>What tech do we use?</h2>
  <p>We only use the latest and greatest technical solutions to build your product. We don't believe in conventional methods, we're ahead of the curve.</p>
  <ul class="tech__list">
    <li>We don't believe in multipage websites, why have individual pages, when you can have a single page application?</li>
    <li>We make the fastest websites possible, in fact, our average time to interactive (TTI) is 18 seconds, that gives your users just enough time to flick the kettle on, whilst they wait for the site to load.</li>
    <li>We can protect you from accessibility legal issues, as we can develop sites that can trick automated checkers into displaying a perfect accessibility score.</li>
    <li>We have developed our own in-house artificial intelligence, that can build flawless websites, hundreds of times faster than conventional developers, we call it the Systematic Hybrid Intelligence Tool.</li>
    <li>We use React, for single page goodness, we use if for websites, mobile apps and even desktop apps: React all the things</li>
  </ul>
