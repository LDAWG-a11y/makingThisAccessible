<p>We're Brad and Chad, trailblazers in the Bay Area tech scene, and we are globally renowned for creating websites and apps that are beyond the skills of other engineers. We're humble, but when we say we are the best, we mean we're the best by a long shot.</p>
<p>We have the expertise and skills to build you a product that will become a return on your investment and there is no technical solution we cannot solve.</p>
<p>we have been building websites longer than Sir Tim Berners-Lee, how many people can legitimately say that? Yup, just us.</p>

      <p>Hey, I'm Brad and I grew up in the Bay Area. I started my tech career really young, along with my brother from another mother, Chad. We used to hang out in my mom's garage, doing computer stuff, from about 6 years old. In fact, we had set up a profitable business, by the time we were both 11.</p>
      <p>I still live in the Bay Area, there's no place like home. Well, I don't actually go home that often, we like to work long days and just crash in the office, we're all about that grind.</p>

      <p>Whassup? I'm Chad and I grew up in the Bay Area. I started getting into tech aged around 6, just hanging with my bro, Brad. We seriously tore up the tech scene round here, at like 11 years old. We have always had a 'can do' attitude to any problem and togther, we make the A Team of developers.</p>
      <p>I actually live next door to Brad, in the Bay Area, we like to be close, as we're brothers, albeit not biologically. There's nothing I like more than spending a long day at the office, a good 18 - 20 hours, just grinding out new products</p>
